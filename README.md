# Trivia Escape Game

## Background Info
Made at our first hackathon, [MHACKS16](https://www.mhacks.org/), with [Amogh Madireddi](https://github.com/amoghmadireddi), [Rutvik Parikh](https://github.com/rutvikparikh11), [Gavin Hardy](https://github.com/GShane325), and [Amey Krishna](https://github.com/amekrish).

## About the Project

Used Python and the University of Michigan GPT-4 API to design an escape room game where players would get questions with a topic and difficulty of their own choice inspired by old dungeon escape games.

## How to Use

Clone the repository and create a config.env file containing your API key. Make sure you have Python and the openai package installed.
