# Trivia Escape Game

Made at our first hackathon, [MHACK16](https://www.mhacks.org/)
Our team included [Amogh Madireddi](https://github.com/amoghmadireddi), [Rutvik Parikh](https://github.com/rutvikparikh11), [Gavin Hardy](https://github.com/GShane325), and [Amey Krishna](https://github.com/amekrish).

Used Python and the University of Michigan GPT-4 API to design a escape room game where players would get questions with a topic and difficulty of their own choice inspired by old dungeon escape games.
